;;; Commentary:

;; Adds support for pdf-view (from `pdf-tools') and DocView buffers in
;; `save-place-mode'.

;; If using pdf-view-mode or doc-view-mode, this package will
;; automatically persist between Emacs sessions the current PDF page,
;; size and other information from `pdf-view-bookmark-make-record' or
;; `doc-view-bookmark-make-record', depending on the mode used.  These
;; information are persisted using `save-place-mode'.  Visiting the
;; same PDF file will restore the previously displayed page and scale
;; amount (if available).

;;; Acknowledgements:

;; - João Pedro <jpedrodeamorim@gmail.com>, for making the package
;;   work with doc-view-mode
;; - vizs, for fixing the compatibility with saveplace in Emacs 30
